# `std::filesystem::path` Example

This repo just contains a very basic example of [C++’s `std::filesystem::path` type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path). It was originally created in order to help me test things out and to help me write [a Stack Overflow question and answer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/78610128/7593853).
