# `std::filesystem::path` Example

This repo just contains a very basic example of [C++‚Äôs `std::filesystem::path` type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path). It was originally created in order to help me test things out and to help me write [a Stack Overflow question and answer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/78610128/7593853).

## How to Build

1. Make sure that you have [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a C++ compiler.

2. Change directory to the root of this repository:

    ```
    cd <path-to-this-repo>
    ```

3. Create a directory to store files generated by CMake:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

4. Run CMake:

    ```
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```

Once that last command finishes, there should be a file named `StdFilesystemPathExample` or `StdFilesystemPathExample.exe` somewhere inside the `build/` directory.
